/**
 * This view is loaded from a NIB, and is the XIB file's
 * root view (and not the File's Owner). => it is `NibLoadable`
 *
 * It is also reusable and has a `reuseIdentifier` (as it's a CollectionViewCell
 * and it uses the CollectionView recycling mechanism) => it is `Reusable`
 *
 * That's why it's annotated with the `NibOwnerLoadable` protocol,
 * Which in fact is just a convenience protocol that combines
 * both `NibLoadable` + `Reusable` protocols.
